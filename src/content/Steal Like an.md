## Overview

- ‚ÄúEverything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again.‚Äù
- We are what we let into our life and the sum of our influences. 
- The concept of "Garbage In, Garbage Out." You have to let new influence and new experiences in your life and leave behind the one that are no longer serving you your purpose. 
- Steal from anywhere that resonates or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work will be authentic. - Jim Jarmusch. 
- Another concept is "Climb your own family tree." You should create your own learning tree. Start from a book and then find few books in the book and learn about them. 
- **School Yourself:** 
	- You have to stay curious about the world you live in and the surrounding you have. 
	- Google the concepts that you don't understand and try to go deep for learning new things. 
	- Always be reading. 
	- Collect books, even if you don't plan non reading them right away. 
- **Save your thefts for later:**
	- Carry a notebook and a pen with you everywhere and write down every important thing that you hear and every interesting thoughts you have. 
	- It is better to take what does not belong to you than to leet it lie around neglected. - Mark Twain

## 2: Don‚Äôt Wait Until You Know Who You Are to Get Started. 
 - **Make things, know thyself**
	 - Making things and doing our work let us figure out who we are truly. 
	 - You are ready. Start making stuff. 
	 - Imposter Syndrome: A person feeling like a phony. 
	 - Ask anybody doing truly creative work, and they'll tell you the truth: They don't know where the good stuff comes from. They just show up to do their thing. Every day. 
 - **Fake it until you make it**
	 - You have to pretend to be something you're not until you are. Or, pretend to be making something until you actually make something. 
	 - You have to dress for the job you want, not the job you have, and you have to start doing the work you want to be doing.
