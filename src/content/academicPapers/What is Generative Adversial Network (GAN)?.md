A **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** is a type of deep learning model designed for generative tasks, particularly in image synthesis, data augmentation, and creative AI applications. GANs consist of two neural networks—the **generator** and the **discriminator**—that work in opposition to improve each other iteratively.  

### **Architecture of GANs**  
GANs are composed of two competing neural networks:  

1. **Generator (G)**:  
   - The generator creates synthetic data that mimics real data distributions.  
   - It takes a random noise vector (often from a Gaussian or uniform distribution) and transforms it into structured data (e.g., an image).  

2. **Discriminator (D)**:  
   - The discriminator is a binary classifier that distinguishes between real and generated data.  
   - It receives both real samples from a dataset and synthetic samples from the generator, and it learns to classify them correctly.  

### **Training Process**  
The GAN training process is based on a **min-max game** where both networks improve over time:  
- The generator tries to **fool** the discriminator by producing more realistic samples.  
- The discriminator attempts to **identify fake samples** accurately.  
- Over time, the generator produces data that is almost indistinguishable from real data.
