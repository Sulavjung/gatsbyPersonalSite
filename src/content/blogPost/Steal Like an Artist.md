Description: Steal from anywhere that resonates or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work will be authentic. - Jim Jarmusch.

In our world brimming with information, where countless voices clamor for attention, it's easy to overlook the wisdom that's been shared time and time again. As the saying goes, "Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again." It's a reminder that inspiration often hides in plain sight, waiting for us to pay attention. Here are some of the things that I learned from the book "Steal Like An Artist" by Austin Kleon. 

## The Sum of Our Influences

Our lives are a reflection of the influences we choose to embrace. We are what we let into our lives, and this amalgamation of influences molds our perspective and creativity. It's the age-old concept of "Garbage In, Garbage Out." We must make room for new experiences and fresh inspiration while shedding influences that no longer serve our purpose.

## Steal from the World

Renowned filmmaker Jim Jarmusch advises us to "steal from anywhere that resonates or fuels your imagination." Be a magpie of inspiration, collecting treasures from all around you â€“ from films to music, books to street signs, and everything in between. Your work becomes authentic when it's a reflection of your unique interpretation of the world's beauty and complexity.

## Create Your Learning Tree

Imagine building your own learning tree, starting from a single book and branching out to explore related topics. It's a journey of self-education where curiosity is your compass, and Google becomes your guide. Reading is your constant companion, and your bookshelf becomes a garden of knowledge to be explored at your leisure.

## School Yourself

Embrace the role of a perpetual student. In a world of ever-evolving information, Google is your classroom. Dive deep into the concepts you don't understand, and never stop reading. Collect books as if they were seeds of knowledge, even if you don't intend to read them immediately.

## Save Your Thefts for Later

Inspiration strikes unexpectedly, and brilliant ideas are fleeting. Carry a notebook and pen wherever you go. Jot down the insights that resonate and the thoughts that spark your imagination. As Mark Twain wisely puts it, "It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected."

## Don't Wait to Get Started

Imposter Syndrome, that feeling of being a phony, haunts even the most creative minds. The truth is, you'll never truly know where the good stuff comes from. Just show up every day and do your thing. As you make things and do your work, you'll discover who you are.

## Fake It Until You Make It

Pretend to be something you're not until you are. Dress for the job you want and start doing the work you aspire to do. The path to becoming is often paved with actions, and by pretending to make something, you'll eventually make it.


## Conclusion
In the grand tapestry of creativity, your journey is an intricate thread. The world is a reservoir of inspiration, and your unique experiences and interpretations enrich the narrative. As you embrace the art of stealing like an artist, remember that creativity is a dynamic process of addition, subtraction, and, most importantly, self-discovery.

So, start today. Make things, know thyself, and let your unique creativity flourish. You are ready. Your story is waiting to be written, your art waiting to be created. Your journey of inspiration and self-discovery begins now.
