##  üìÅ Overview
Over the last few years of my life, I've learned to love, enjoy, and update my understanding from book. With that in mind, I have gone through books that talks about productivity, business, relationships, and so much more. Out of more than 30-40 books, *The 4-Hour Workweek* by Timothy Ferris is unarguably the most interesting and motivating book for me. In this book, he advocates for a new way of thinking about work and life. Ferris argues that the traditional modal of working a 9-to-5 job for 40+ years before retiring is not only outdated, but is also a poor way to achieve financial freedom. Instead, Ferris suggests everyone to build businesses and income streams that allow you to work less and live more. 

## üï† How I found about this book? 
I came across this book when I was at gym listening to the podcast called [Impact Theory](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/impact-theory-with-tom-bilyeu/id1191775648?i=1000591585947) by Tom Bailyeu. 

## üßò Who should Read It?
*The 4-Hour Workweek* is a good read for anyone who is interested in finding ways to work less and live more, or who is looking to build a business that can provide passive income. It may be particularly appealing to people who are feeling unfulfilled in their current work situation, or who are looking for ways to achieve financial freedom and independence.

## ü™¥ What are the noticeable changes in me from this book?
- I've started to notice that being career-focused stops me from exploring different areas in life.
- It created this fire within me to work toward things that gives me freedom in life. 

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Major Points from Each Chapter
Within this section of the reading, I will try to keep the points precise and easy to read. With that being said, I highly recommend everyone to read the book at least once throughly. 

### Chapter 1: 
- Power in not determined by money. But it is determined by the options you have in your life. 
- To begin the life of 4-hour work week, you have to change your perspective toward life substantially. 
- Trying to reach arbitrary financial goal is like trying to hit moving target. You have to let go of these goals and start living the life as you always wanted. 

### Chapter 2:
- There will always be some kind of rules to live by in life like in game. Instead of trying to live by rule, you should think of how you can bend them in your benefits. 
- You shouldn't be different just for the shake of being different. Different is only better when it's more affective and let you have more fun. 
- Retirement should be treated as the worst case scenario. 
- You should rest to work your best. 
- Work should be measured by production rather than contribution of time. 
- You cannot wait for the perfect condition to leave your old life behind. You should commit to the new life and correct your actions with time. 
- You shouldn't worry how you might affect other. 
- Only apologize when you really screwed up. 
- Pay attention and play to your strength as opposed to correcting your weaknesses. You should multiply your successes rather than repairing your weaknesses. 
- Too much of the good thing is bad. If you receive too much of the good thing, you will end up hating it. 
- Stop using money as an excuse to why you are not living the life you want to live. It is just the barrier in your mind that stops you from evaluating your mistakes in life. 
- Pay attention to relative income as opposed to absolute income. Absolute takes in account just money while relative take in account of time. Two people make same amount of money in a year but one who have to work less will be the richer of the two. 
- Do not avoid all criticism but just the destructive kind. 

### Chapter 3:
- You are free to leave your job at anytime you want but only the people who could conquer the fear will do it so. 
- Only way to lose the fear of leaving the job is to determine the worst case scenario. Then, you can plan for it and manage it accordingly. 
- Don't hope for things to get better over time. At some point, you have to cut your losses and look out for your own happiness.
