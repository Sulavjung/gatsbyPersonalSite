This article explains how to dynamically set the page title in React or Gatsby using the `react-helmet` library. By following these steps, you can set the page title dynamically based on the component's props, making it easier to manage and update page titles in your application.
1. Install `react-helmet` by running the following command in your terminal:

```js
  //In terminal
   npm install react-helmet
```
2. Import the `Helmet` component from `react-helmet` in your component file:
```js
   import {Helmet} from 'react-helmet';
```
3. Use the `Helmet` component in your component `render` method, and pass in the title as prop:
```js
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Helmet>
        <title>{this.props.title}</title>
      </Helmet>
      {/* rest of the component */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
4. In your page component, pass in the `title` prop to the component:
```js
   import React from 'react';
   import MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent';
	
	const MyPage = () => {
	  const pageTitle = 'My Page Title';
	
	  return <MyComponent title={pageTitle} />;
	};
	
	export default MyPage;
```
In this example, the `title` prop is passed to the `MyComponent` component, which is then used in the `Helmet` component to set the page title dynamically.

Note that the `react-helmet` library can be used to set other meta tags and attributes as well, such as the `meta description`, `canonical URL`, `og:title`, and more.

### Best Personal Use Case: 
Using the `Helmet` component inside a template class can be helpful for setting dynamic page titles across multiple pages in a web application. By creating a template class that incorporates the `Helmet` component, you can easily include the necessary code to dynamically set the page title in each of your pages without having to repeat the same code in each page component. This approach can save time and reduce the likelihood of introducing errors or inconsistencies in your code. Additionally, if you need to update the page title across all pages, you can simply update the template class instead of having to modify each individual page component.
