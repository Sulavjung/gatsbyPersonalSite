<h1 className = "text-center" > Data Structure with Java </h1>

**Course Overview:**

"Data Structures with Java" is a comprehensive course that provides students with the knowledge and skills to design, implement, and analyze fundamental data structures using the Java programming language. Throughout the course, students will explore essential concepts such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. By delving into these topics, students will gain the ability to create efficient and well-organized data structures and understand their impact on algorithmic efficiency.

## What You Will Learn

1. **Arrays:** Understand the fundamentals of arrays, including their representation, manipulation, and common operations. Explore the strengths and limitations of arrays in various scenarios.

2. **Linked Lists:** Learn about linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Understand their construction, insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

3. **Stacks and Queues:** Explore the concepts of stacks and queues and their respective operations. Learn about the stack and queue data structures and their practical applications.

4. **Trees:** Dive into tree data structures, including binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees (such as AVL and Red-Black trees). Learn about tree traversal algorithms, searching, insertion, deletion, and common tree-based applications.

5. **Graphs:** Understand the properties and representations of graphs, including directed and undirected graphs. Learn about graph traversal algorithms (e.g., depth-first search and breadth-first search), shortest path algorithms, and applications of graphs.

6. **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:** Gain the ability to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms and data structures. Understand Big O notation and its significance in evaluating the efficiency of code.

7. **Algorithmic Problem Solving:** Apply data structures and algorithms to solve a variety of algorithmic problems. Learn problem-solving techniques, algorithm design principles, and strategies for tackling real-world challenges.
