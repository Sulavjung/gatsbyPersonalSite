<h1 className = "text-center" > Web Software Development </h1>

In the course of **Software Web Development**, you will explore various topics related to web development, including **UNIX**, client-side and server-side programming, database connectivity, and building Internet applications. The course aims to provide you with an introductory foundation in using **Linux**, command line tools, version control with **Git** and **GitHub**, as well as fundamental web stack technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Node.js** with the **Express** framework. The primary objective is to equip interested individuals with the necessary skills to develop dynamic and interactive web applications.

# Topics Covered:

1. **UNIX**: Introduction to UNIX and its command line tools. You will learn how to navigate the file system, perform file operations, and utilize various UNIX utilities. This knowledge is essential for working in a Linux environment.

2. **HTTP**: An overview of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the foundation of communication on the World Wide Web. Understanding HTTP is crucial for developing web applications and interacting with servers.

3. **Git**: Introduction to version control using Git, a distributed version control system. You will learn how to create repositories, manage branches, commit changes, and collaborate with others using GitHub. Version control is vital for tracking code changes and enabling efficient collaboration in software development.

4. **HTML**: Comprehensive coverage of HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the standard markup language for creating web pages. You will learn how to structure content, use semantic elements, and incorporate multimedia into web pages. HTML is the backbone of every web application.

5. **CSS**: In-depth exploration of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to style and visually enhance web pages. You will gain proficiency in applying styles, managing layouts, and implementing responsive designs. CSS brings life to HTML pages by defining their appearance.

6. **JavaScript**: Introduction to JavaScript, a versatile programming language used for client-side scripting. You will learn JavaScript syntax, data types, control flow, and functions. JavaScript enables interactivity and dynamic behavior in web applications.

7. **Node/Express**: Hands-on experience with Node.js, a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser, and Express, a popular web application framework. You will build server-side applications, handle routing, and connect to databases, enhancing their ability to create robust web applications.
