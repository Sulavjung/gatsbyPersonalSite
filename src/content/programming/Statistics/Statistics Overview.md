<h1 className = "text-center" > Probability and Statistics with Computing </h1>

**"Probability and Statistics with Computing"** is a course that combines theoretical foundations of probability and statistics with practical computing skills. The course covers topics such as probability distributions, random variables, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and data visualization.

Students will learn how to use statistical software such as R to perform data analysis and simulations. The course aims to develop the students' ability to apply statistical techniques to real-world problems, as well as to critically evaluate the results of statistical analysis.

The course is suitable for students from a wide range of disciplines, including mathematics, computer science, engineering, and social sciences. The course may be taken as an introduction to probability and statistics, or as a more advanced course for students with prior knowledge in these areas.

Upon completion of the course, students will have gained a solid understanding of probability and statistics, as well as the ability to apply statistical methods to solve real-world problems using computing tools.
